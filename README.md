# 🍷 WageFix STO Demo - Mobius RWA Tokenization
This repository showcases a Mobius-compliant Security Token Offering (STO) infrastructure for tokenizing **alcohol/spirits** real-world assets.

## 🔁 Flow Architecture

Define alcohol/spirits deal data → wrap underlying asset metadata → issue RWA tokens via Mobius platform → link to smart contracts on Solana or Ethereum → register legal wrapper (e.g. LEXDAO or Swiss-based DLT registry) → attach compliance logic (KYC/AML/zkKYC) → bind off-chain valuation oracle (e.g. Chainlink or Mobius-native API) → secure custody via Taurus or Sygnum → map token to ISIN or internal asset ID → onboard investors via web3 wallet → whitelist wallets through validator multisig → enable token trading on permissioned pools → automate reporting via GPT/LLM for real-time audits → connect fiat ramps for redemption or settlement in XCHF or USDC → launch token across both Swiss and US entities via mirrored issuance structures with cross-border compliance layer.

## 🛠️ Components

- Solidity: `contracts/WageFixSTO.sol` – ERC1400-like token logic
- Rust: `rust/sto_listener/` – Kafka listener that auto-mints tokens
- Python: (optional) CLI trigger or mock oracle
- Docs: Compliance, architecture, and token metadata in `/docs`
- Scripts: Full setup in `setup_mobius_stack.sh`, healing in `heal_sto_listener.sh`

---

## ✅ How to Run

```bash
# Setup the full project
./setup_mobius_stack.sh

# Heal and fix any Rust mismatches
./heal_sto_listener.sh

# Compile and run Kafka → Web3 minting
cd rust/sto_listener
cargo run
